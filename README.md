# Tic_Tac_Toe-Programming-Contest-2022
Suppose, one day you ask your parents for a new phone/laptop and like traditional brown parents they start
roasting you. Now, in order to protect your dignity, you have to show them what you learned studying CSE.
So, you quickly decide to design a tic-tac-toe game to reestablish your dignity and ask for a
MacBook/iPhone.

The rules of the game are:
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full but no winner is decided, the game ends in a tie.
- The valid input range is between 1 to 9. The same input cannot be given more than once.
